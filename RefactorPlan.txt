-Move individual components of scene to their own files (Scene, cameras, lights, etc)
-Move functions to their own files (light spawning, sorting, etc)
-Figure out how to auto-sort without having to press button, 
    probably a loop on a delay


Program Flow:
    Set Up Scene -> Set Up Plane -> Set Up Lighting ->Set Up Camera
    ->Set Up Unsorted Array -> Spawn Trees ->Spawn Ghosts depending on numbers in Array
    -> Sort Array, moving ghosts around to match -> When done, all green
